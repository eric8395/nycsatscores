# NYC High School SAT Scores - Data Exploration, Visualization, & Analysis

As a native New Yorker who was educated in the public school system, I have always been curious about the diverse ethnic background of the student population. 

The goal of this project is to explore a set of data related to the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or more commonly known as the SAT. Are there clear patterns or observations in the data that can possibly explain how student performance can be determined? 

This is also an opportunity to practice with data cleaning and the various visual packages that the MatPlot library and Seaborn have to offer.
