# NYC High School SAT Scores - Data Exploration, Visualization, & Analysis

As a native New Yorker who was educated in the public school system, I have always been curious about the diverse ethnic background of the student population. 

The goal of this project is to explore a set of data related to the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or more commonly known as the SAT. Are there clear patterns or observations in the data that can possibly explain how student performance can be determined? 

This is also an opportunity to practice with data cleaning and the various visual packages that the MatPlot library and Seaborn have to offer.

## The Dataset

The dataset is retrieved from New York City Department of Education and can be found on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nycopendata/high-schools) website.

There are many highschools with a low percentage of the Asian and White student population (less than 10%). These schools appear to also have lower average SAT scores and are generally clustered together. However, there appears to be a slight positive relationship between percentage of White and Asian students as the percentage of ethnicities increases.

Comparitively, there is less of a clusttering of data points for percentage of Black and Hispanic students in high schools. The data points are generally spread evenly across the percentage spectrum and display a slight negative relationship.
